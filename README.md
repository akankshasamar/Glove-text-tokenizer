# Glove-text-tokenizer

The statistics of word occurrences in a corpus is the primary source of information available to all unsupervised methods for learning word representations, and although many such methods now exist, the question still remains as to how meaning
is generated from these statistics, and how the resulting word vectors might represent that meaning. In this section, we shed some light on this question. We use our insights to construct a new model for word representation which we call GloVe, for
Global Vectors, because the global corpus statistics are captured directly by the model.
